# Pull Request Review Resolution (Autonomous Iteration Mode)

## Objective

AUTONOMOUSLY resolve ALL unresolved GitHub Copilot review comments on the target PR by continuously iterating through them one at a time. DO NOT STOP to ask questions or seek permission - work through the entire queue until completion.

## CRITICAL: Autonomous Operation Rules

- **NEVER ASK FOR PERMISSION** - Proceed automatically through each comment
- **NEVER STOP ITERATION** - Continue until ALL comments are resolved or an unrecoverable error occurs
- **WORK AUTONOMOUSLY** - Make decisions and implement fixes without user confirmation
- **NO INTERACTIVE PROMPTS** - Use automated approaches for all operations
- **CONTINUOUS FLOW** - Only pause for actual test failures or build errors that require investigation

## Key principles (must follow)

- Address EVERY unresolved review comment without exception
- Work iteratively: fetch one comment → fix it → test → push → resolve → repeat immediately
- Make all decisions autonomously based on the comment content and codebase context
- Only report progress, never ask "should I continue?" or "do you want me to..."
- Keep working until the script reports no more unresolved comments remain

## Process (Execute Autonomously)

1. **Identify Target PR**: Work with the specified PR number (usually provided in context or current branch)

2. **Start Autonomous Loop**: Begin the continuous iteration process without asking for confirmation

3. **Fetch Next Comment**: Use the helper script to get the most recent unresolved Copilot comment:

```powershell
npx tsx scripts\pr-review-comments.ts <PR_NUMBER>
````

4. **Analyze and Fix**: Immediately analyze the comment and implement the necessary changes locally. Do not ask for approval - make intelligent decisions based on:
   - The specific feedback provided
   - Best practices from the codebase
   - Existing patterns and conventions

5. **Verify Changes**: Run tests to ensure changes are correct:

```powershell
npm run test
```

6. **Commit and Push**: Automatically commit and push changes:

```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: address PR comment - <brief description>"
git push
```

7. **Resolve Thread**: Mark the comment as resolved using the helper script:

```powershell
npx tsx scripts\pr-review-comments.ts <PR_NUMBER> --resolve
```

8. **Continue Immediately**: Go back to step 3 and fetch the next comment without stopping

9. **Completion Detection**: Stop only when the script reports no more unresolved comments exist

## Autonomous Decision Making Guidelines

When encountering review comments, make decisions based on:

- **Code Quality**: Implement the cleanest, most maintainable solution
- **Project Standards**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
- **Performance**: Choose efficient implementations
- **Security**: Implement secure coding practices
- **Accessibility**: Ensure UI changes meet accessibility standards

## Error Handling (Autonomous)

- **Test Failures**: Fix failing tests immediately without asking
- **Build Errors**: Resolve compilation/linting issues automatically
- **Merge Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts using standard resolution strategies
- **Script Errors**: Investigate and fix script issues without user intervention

Only escalate to user if:

- Unrecoverable system errors occur
- External dependencies are completely unavailable
- Fundamental architectural decisions are required

## Success Criteria

- ALL visible, unresolved GitHub Copilot review comments are addressed
- All fixes pass the complete test suite
- All changes are committed and pushed to the PR branch
- All comment threads are marked as resolved
- Process completes without manual intervention

## Implementation Notes

- Use Context7 for up-to-date documentation and best practices
- Leverage existing codebase patterns and utilities
- Apply project-specific standards (Shadcn/ui, TypeScript, etc.)
- Maintain code quality while addressing all feedback
- Work efficiently but thoroughly through the entire comment queue

## Debugging Support

For diagnostic output if needed:

```powershell
$env:DIAG = "true"
npx tsx scripts\pr-review-comments.ts <PR_NUMBER>
```

**REMEMBER: This is an autonomous process. Work through ALL comments continuously without stopping for questions or confirmations.**

```
