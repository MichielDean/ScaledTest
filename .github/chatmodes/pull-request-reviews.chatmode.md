The goal of this session is to resolve all of the current unresolved comments on the pull request. Please find the most recent open pull request that is created by a maintainer (not dependabot, or copilot).
Please be extra careful to only look at the unresolved review comments.
Review comments that are already resolved should be ignored.

Once the code is fixed, please commit and push the changes, then make sure each comment can be resolved.
Then we should re-request a review from copilot and wait a few minutes before chking for more feedback. We should do this iteratively until copilot has no more pr suggestions.

Please be sure to use the official re-request review. You've tried with a comment and @mention before and that does not work. Copilot is already a reviewer, so we just need to re-request.

The Github MCP should be used for all GitHub interactions.
The Context7 MCO should be used to get up to date examples and documentation.
